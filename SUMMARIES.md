# Summaries
Key summaries of each chapter.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Algorithms
- Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you’re searching through grows.
- Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.
- Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
- Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.

## Chapter 2 - Selection Sort
- Your computer’s memory is like a giant set of drawers.
- When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list.
- With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other.
- With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one.
- Arrays allow fast reads.
- Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes.
- All elements in the array should be the same type (all ints, all doubles, and so on).

## Chapter 3 - Recursion
- Recursion is when a function calls itself.
- Every recursive function has two cases: the base case and the recursive case.
- A stack has two operations: push and pop.
- All function calls go onto the call stack.
- The call stack can get very large, which takes up a lot of memory.

## Chapter 4 - Quicksort
- D&C works by breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller pieces. If you’re using D&C on a list, the base case is probably an empty array or an array with one element.
- If you’re implementing quicksort, choose a random element as the pivot. The average runtime of quicksort is O(n log n)!
- The constant in Big O notation can matter sometimes. That’s why quicksort is faster than merge sort.
- The constant almost never matters for simple search versus binary search, because O(log n) is so much faster than O(n) when your list gets big.

## Chapter 5 - Hash Tables
- You can make a hash table by combining a hash function with an array.
- Collisions are bad. You need a hash function that minimizes collisions.
- Hash tables have really fast search, insert, and delete.
- Hash tables are good for modeling relationships from one item to another item.
- Once your load factor is greater than 0.7, it’s time to resize your hash table.
- Hash tables are used for caching data (for example, with a web server).
- Hash tables are great for catching duplicates.

## Chapter 6 - Breadth-First Search
- Breadth-first search tells you if there’s a path from A to B.
- If there’s a path, breadth-first search will find the shortest path.
- If you have a problem like “find the shortest X,” try modeling your problem as a graph, and use breadth-first search to solve.
- A directed graph has arrows, and the relationship follows the direction of the arrow (rama -> adit means “rama owes adit money”).
Undirected graphs don’t have arrows, and the relationship goes both ways (ross - rachel means “ross dated rachel and rachel dated ross”).
- Queues are FIFO (First In, First Out).
- Stacks are LIFO (Last In, First Out).
- You need to check people in the order they were added to the search list, so the search list needs to be a queue. Otherwise, you won’t get the shortest path.
- Once you check someone, make sure you don’t check them again. Otherwise, you might end up in an infinite loop.

# Chapter 7 - Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Breadth-first search is used to calculate the shortest path for an unweighted graph.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path for a weighted graph.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm works when all the weights are positive.
- If you have negative weights, use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
