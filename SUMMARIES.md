# Summaries
Key summaries of each chapter.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Algorithms
- Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you’re searching through grows.
- Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.
- Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
- Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.

## Chapter 2 - Selection Sort
- Your computer’s memory is like a giant set of drawers.
- When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list.
- With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other.
- With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one.
- Arrays allow fast reads.
- Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes.
- All elements in the array should be the same type (all ints, all doubles, and so on).
